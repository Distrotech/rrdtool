Accomplishments
---------------
* RRDtool 1.3

  * The new major version has been released in early summer, containing
    major updates to both the database and the graphing layer.

  * Subsequent releases of the 1.3.x series focused on stability, backward
    compatibility and performance improvements.

* RRDtool 1.2.x

  * Several minor stability and portability have been addressed with new
    minor releases. The 1.2 series remains the most widely used version of
    RRDtool since it is present in a wide variety of Linux distributions.

* Development of RRDtool 1.4

  With the release of RRDtool 1.3 trunk was opened for work on RRDtool 1.4. 
  New features include:

  - RRDcached for massive performance enhancements for large installations
    with hundreds of thousands of RRD files.

  - SQL Database access for RRDtool graph. This allows to use RRDtool
    excellent graphing capabilities to be used on time series data acquired
    directly from a SQL database (thought libdbi).

  RRDtool 1.4 is in a stabilization phase now, prior to release of the first
  release candidates.

Current Activities
------------------

* Code Maintenance. Mails on the mailing-lists and directly to me indicate
  compatibility issues or suggest little changes. These are often
  implemented directly.

* Mailing-list, Web-server, Trac Maintenance. The on-line resources for
  RRDtool are kept up-to-date, in working order and spam free.

* LISA Tutorials and Bofs on RRDtool

* Run-Up for RRDtool 1.4 release in 2009

* Fully automated and minimally tested nightly releases of the 1.2, 1.3 and
  trunk code.

Planned Activities
------------------

* Release of RRDtool 1.4.0

* Continued support for 1.2.x, 1.3.x 

* Development of RRDtool 1.5

  The major feature of 1.5 will be the portable data format that allows to
  read and write rrd files across all platforms where rrdtool is supported.
  Preliminary information about this feature can be found in.
