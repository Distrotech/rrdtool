  RRDtool are kept up-to-date, in working order and spam free.

  dealt with within a few days. Most reported bugs are resolved within a
  few days.

Accomplishments
---------------
* RRDtool 1.3

  * Migration form libart to Cairo/Pango is complete providing versatile
    basis for graphical output.

    - Improved stability
    - PDF output with embeded TrueType fonts, equivalent to
      what is seen in the standard PNG output.
    - Anti-Aliasing can be disabled for 'rrdtool 1.0 look'
    - Access to the standard font management system (fontconfig)
      for access to a wide range of fonts.
    - Inline markup, allowing font, color, size, boldness changes
      in all text elements of the rrdtool output

  * Performance Improvements. Working with contributors, the RRDtool
    data access was switched to MMAP. Together with appropriate madvise
    settings this lead to a massively log-update-performance, coupled with
    better much better cache management.

  RRDtool 1.3 beta will be released for LinuxWorld 2007.

  * Research into a portable dataformat for RRDtool has shown a promising
    implementation strategy.
