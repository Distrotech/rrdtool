Status Report on RRDtool OSS Project
====================================

Current Activites
-----------------

* Code Maintenance. Mails on the Mailinglists and directly to me indicate
  compatility issues or suggest little changes. These are often implemented
  directly.

* Mailinglist, Webserver, Trac Maintenance. The online resources for
  RRDtool are kept up-to-date, in working order and spam free.

* Bug Fixing. Bugs reported through the Trac bugreport Form are normally
  dealt with within a few days.

Accomplishments
---------------
* All Online Resources migrated away from the University Resources
  to http://oss.oetiker.ch and https://lists.oetiker.ch

* RRD tutorial written and held at the LinuxForum.DK
  http://www.linuxforum.dk/2007/program/saturday/Tobi_Oetiker.shtml

* RRDtool 1.2.16, 1.2.17, 1.2.18, 1.2.19 released
  https://lists.oetiker.ch/pipermail/rrd-announce/

* Many small fixed in both the documentation and the graph code. The
  stricter parsing intruduced in 1.2.16 brough a number of odd coding
  practices of rrdtool users to light.

* Rewrote and stabilized the build process for the rrdtool python bindings
  based on contributions form Zenoss.

* Integrated patches for improved stability in multi-threaded environments

* Improved rrd_fetch behaviour in situations where RRA coverage was not
  complete.

Planned Activites
-----------------

* From April to June: Start on the implementation of the 1.3 features listed
  in http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool-trac/wiki/RRDtool13

  The first order of work will be the switch from libart to cairo.

* Maintenance of series 1.2.x
