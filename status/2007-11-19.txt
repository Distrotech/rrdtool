  RRDtool are kept up-to-date, in working order and spam free.

* LISA Tutorials on RRDtool

* Beta Testing for 1.3 release

* Planning for 1.4 release

Accomplishments
---------------
* RRDtool 1.3

  * At Linux World I have released the first BETA for RRDtool 1.3.

  * Unfortunately there has not been all that much response to the Beta
    release. Either it works for most who try or they are happy with what
    they have. In any event I will release 1.3.0 befor the years end,
    probably followed by a rapid succession of updates as more people will
    start using the 'real' update.

  * People who have been testing the new release have seen dramatic
    performance improvements with linux 2.6.  See als next section.

* RRDtool 1.2.25

  * Work presented by Dave Plonka at LISA 2007 suggests that Linux 2.6
    read-a-head behaviour is badly hurting rrdtool performance . Using
    fadvise RANDOM it is possible to counteract this and provide a massive
    performance boost. With this he was able to run an RRD setup with over
    200k RRDs updated in a 5 minute cycle. Other users have since confirmed
    this.

    Daves work is included in rrdtool 1.2.25 as well as 1.3beta.
