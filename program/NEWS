RRDTOOL NEWS
============
Major Changes between 1.2.x and 1.3.x

see http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool-trac/wiki/RRDtool13
for up to date information

File access methods (Bernhard Fischer)
-------------------
* introduced file-accessor functions rrd_read/rrd_seek/rrd_write
* implemented full mmap-based file access with madvise hints for improved
  scalability, much reduced memory-footprint and much less blocking on
  disk
* implemented optional full file-descriptor access instead of FILE* access

Graphing (Tobi Oetiker)
--------
* libart has been replaced by cairo/pango
* pango markup is supported
* full gridfitting 
* --graph-render-mode=mono for non antialiased graphing
* --font-render-mode=mono for non antialiased fonts
* fonts come through fontconfig, use the Pango fontnameing
  scheme -> 'Times 20' ... it is not possible to use
  truetype fonts directly anymore.
* Tabs are position independent.
* TRENDNAN filter that ignores NAN values while caculating the TREND data. (Timo Stripf)
* --full-size-mode to specify the outer border of the image and not just of the graphing canvas (Matthew Chambers)
* TEXTALIGN command to alter default text alignment behaviour
* C API supports in-memory graphing with rrd_graph_in_memory (Evan Miller)
 
Forecasting (Evan Miller)
-----------
* the new MHWPREDICT consolidation function uses a variation of the Holt-Winters
  method. It is a drop-in replacement for HWPREDICT, and is better suited for
  data whose seasonal variations grow or shrink in proportion to the average.

Locale Independent Input
------------------------
* Regardles of locale you are in, rrdtool always expects input to be numbers (LC_NUMERIC)
  in C or POSIX locale for numbers. (not 1,1 but 1.1) this is necessary to make
  things like RPN work as it uses , as a separator.

RRDTOOL NEWS
============
Major Changes between 1.0.x and 1.2.x

Graphing
--------

* rewritten graphics generation based on libart.
  - anti-aliased output
  - alpha transparency support
  - truetype fonts
 
* additional graphics formats: EPS, PDF, SVG

* extended multi-part documentation

* VDEF support; define and use variables.  Find, and use, the
  maximum rate seen by rrdtool; compute and show the average

* Sliding window (trend) analysis
  Compute a smoother average, for instance over the last 6 CDPs

* percentile (95th or other)
  Remove peaks, 95 percent of all rates are at or below the
  returned value

Logging
-------
* a second logging interface: rrdtool updatev
  Verbose updating of the database; show CPDs being created

* Aberrant Behavior Detection with Holt-Winters Forecasting
  Compare current data with expected data, detect and log when
  the rates are outside expected levels

* COMPUTE data type for artificial data-sources calculating their
  input using RPN math and data from the other data-sources.
 
Incompatibilities
-----------------
* Colons in COMMENT arguments to rrdtool graph must be escaped with a backslash

* the --alt-y-mrtg option is gone or rather since 1.2.7 it is back but
  without functionality.

* In pipe mode, rrdtool answers with OK only if it was successful with the
  command. Otherwhise the answer will be ERROR...


Behind the Scenes
-----------------
* In order to support Holt-Winters and Calculated Datasources,
  the rrdtool data format has changed. While the new version of rrdtool can
  read files created with rrdtool 1.0.x. It is not possible to read files
  created by rrdtool-1.2.x with rrdtool-1.0.x

* External libraries are not included with rrdtool anymore. This is in line
  with todays trend of using shared libraries everywhere. With the exception
  of the cgi library most things required by rrdtool will be found on every recent
  system.

* Memory Mapped IO support for faster logging.
