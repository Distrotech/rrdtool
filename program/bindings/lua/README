RRDLua is a Lua module for RRD functions.

Compiling:

Just run "configure" from the top RRDTool package dir and then 'make'.
You should have lua and lua-dev packages installed before executing
configure.

Testing:

Enter the bindings/lua dir, run 'make test' and use your preferred
viewer to display the just created graph 'test.png'. If you can read
"Enjoy Lua RRDtool module!" on the picture, everything went fine.

Installation:

Run 'make install' from the top dir of the RRDtool package. The Lua
module will be installed in the same RRDtool installation dir,
under the subdir lib/lua/<lua_version>.
