  * Spelling corrections from Martin Schulze (Closes: #110784)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Sep 2001 13:13:22 -0400

rrdtool (1.0.33-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ship with pre-generated files from autoconf2.50/automake, rather than
    pulling them in at build-time, in order to work around the current
    libtool mess.  This makes the diff less manageable, but should make
    the build more stable.
  * debian/control: remove build-dependencies on autoconf/automake/libtool
  * debian/rules: don't call autoconf/automake
  * Fix shlibs file (it was trying to use a substitution)
  * configure.in: remove makefiles that no longer exist from AC_OUTPUT.
    Apparently this is an error in autoconf 2.50.
  * configure.in: Remove wacky logic to pull PIC flags out of libtool, and
    let libtool do the right thing.
  * debian/rules: shlibs.local hackery is no longer necessary, removed

rrdtool (1.0.33-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * This is yet another patch release to fix some distribution/compilation
    problems.  There should be no visible changes for Debian users from

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Mar 2001 02:27:53 -0500

rrdtool (1.0.32-3) unstable; urgency=low

    tcl8.0 (Closes: #87357)
  * debian/control: Build-depend on tcl8.3-dev
  * debian/rules: tclconfigdir = /usr/lib/tcl8.3

  * configure.in: (upstream) AC_SUBST(TCL_VERSION)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Feb 2001 02:25:46 -0500

rrdtool (1.0.32-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  Hopefully this one will last more than 24
    hours (Closes: #75771)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Feb 2001 20:13:09 -0500

rrdtool (1.0.27-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Updated for new Perl policy
  * debian/rules: Don't use install-stamp; it causes more problems than it
    prevents
  * debian/rules: Don't call dh_suidregister; we didn't use it anyway
  * debian/control: Build-depend on the new debhelper for dh_perl
  * debian/control: rrdtool-tcl only seems to work with 8.0, so depend on
    tcl8.0
  * debian/control: Build-depend on perl 5.6.0+
  * debian/librrd?-perl: Updated for new Perl filesystem layout

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Feb 2001 19:04:11 -0500

rrdtool (1.0.27-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Handle DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS debug, nostrip
  * debian/rules: Separate out "configure" target
  * debian/rules: Miscellaneous cleanup
  * Recompile librrds-perl against perl-5.6

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Dec 2000 21:23:55 -0500

rrdtool (1.0.27-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix Build-Depends to reflect our dependency on dpkg-dev >= 1.7.0 |
    librrd0.  The old dpkg can only calculate our dependencies correctly
    if the runtime library is installed on the system, so potato users
    must either install the potato librrd0 or the new dpkg-dev
    (Closes: #77479)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Nov 2000 20:39:55 -0500

rrdtool (1.0.27-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to comply with policy 3.2.1.0:
    - Don't build with -g by default
  * Build-Depend on tcl8.0-dev (not tcl-dev), since that is the only
    version we currently work with.
  * Added automake to Build-Depends (oops)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Nov 2000 22:29:02 -0500

rrdtool (1.0.27-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Big packaging cleanup release.
  * Fixed perl module compilation to link with the shared library, rather
    than including a copy of the static library inside the .so (also fixes
    a lintian error, shlib-with-non-pic-code in librrds-perl)
  * Fixed tcl module compilation to link with the shared library, rather
    than including a copy of the static library inside the .so (also fixes
    a lintian error, shlib-with-non-pic-code in rrdtool-tcl)
  * The above shrunk the size of the perl and tcl library packages from
    60k each to about 20k (perl) and 16k (tcl)
  * We can now use shlibdeps to calculate the dependencies for
    librrds-perl, so those will be more correct now
  * Rather than include Makefile.in changes in the .diff.gz, just keep our
    modifications to Makefile.am and run automake in debian/rules.  This
    makes the .diff.gz much smaller and cleaner
  * Fixed shared library dependencies all around to be smarter
  * rrdtool package now Suggests librrds-perl (rather than depending on
    perl), as it is only needed for an auxiliary script for converting
    mrtg data

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Nov 2000 19:34:05 -0500

  * Upstream source ships with cgilib-0.4, gd-1.3, libpng-1.0.3, and
    zlib-1.3.3 (!).  Build process is modified to skip building these, and
    instead link with the Debian versions.
  * Modifications for gd 1.6.1 included removal of GIF support (no longer
    included with gd as of 1.6)
