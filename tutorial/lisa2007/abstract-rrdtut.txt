RRDtool as a Communication Tool
===============================
A tutorial by Tobias Oetiker

Abstract
--------
Over the last few years RRDtool has become the standard method for handling
time-series data in the networking area. It takes care of all the work
related to data storage and presentation. Many users only access
RRDtool through some front end Application like Cacti or Cricket. 

In this two hour tutorial you will learn how RRDtool works from a
programmers point of view, and how you can use it to write your own custom
Monitoring applications. An emphasis will be put on presentation aspects.
The best data is worth only as much as you bosses and customers understand
and appreciate the graphs you create with it.

Attendees are expected to have some scripting experience.
