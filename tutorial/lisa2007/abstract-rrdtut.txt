RRDtool as a Communication Tool
===============================
A half day tutorial by Tobias Oetiker

Abstract

Over the last few years RRDtool has become the standard method for handling
time-series data in the networking area. RRDtool takes care of all the work
related to data storage and presentation. Many users only access
RRDtool through some front-end application like Cacti or Cricket. 

In this two hour tutorial you will learn how RRDtool works from a
programmers point of view, and how you can use it to write your own custom
