<description> Endian Firewall Community is a "turn-key" linux security
distribution that turns every system into a full featured security
appliance. The software has been designed with "usability in mind" and
is very easy to install, use and manage, without losing its flexibility.
The features include a stateful packet inspection firewall,
application-level proxies for various protocols (HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP)
with antivirus support, virus and spamfiltering for email traffic (POP
and SMTP), content filtering of Web traffic and a "hassle free" VPN
solution (based on OpenVPN).
