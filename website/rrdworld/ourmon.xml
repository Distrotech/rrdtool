Ourmon is a statistically oriented open-source network monitoring and
anomaly detection system.  It may be regarded as an open source
equivalent of SNMP RMON II.  It is based on promiscuous mode packet
collection on Ethernet (typically) interfaces.  Ourmon does not collect
all the packets because one principle design goal is to extract signal
from noise, and not store all the noise in a giant bag under the
assumption that you can look at it "later" (there is no later).
Instead it attempts to find important data and summarize it.  Data
is displayed on the web via pictures or reports.  Features include
RRDTOOL graphs built from user-defined BPF expressions, topn flow
lists, topn ports, topn synning IP hosts, top UDP error makers, top
scanners, and IRC channels and hosts.  Ourmon's anomaly detection
features include TCP and UDP anomalous hosts, IRC "evil" networks
(botnets) and a lovely graph that displays the number of remote and
local scanners. TCP data also includes information about P2P using
hosts, and soon will allow traffic classification via user-suppled
PCRE pattern tags.
