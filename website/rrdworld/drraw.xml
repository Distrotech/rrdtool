<description> drraw is a simple web based presentation front-end for RRDtool that allows you to interactively build graphs of your own design. A
graph definition can be turned into a template which may be applied to many Round Robin Database files. drraw specializes in providing an easy mean
of displaying data stored with RRDtool and does not care about how the data is collected, making it a great complement to other RRDtool front-ends.
