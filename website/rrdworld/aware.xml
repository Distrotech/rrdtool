The *Aware* project is an effort to create a software framework
to measure, monitor, and control computer system resources. Aware is
intended to enable system administrators tune system variables, set
monitoring/security alarms and build adaptive distributed systems.
Aware modules may be linked into applications making them 'aware' and
able to participate in the larger managed system.
