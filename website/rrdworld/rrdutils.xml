            <description> Is a set of tools intended to help the creation
and graphing
of RRD files. The RRD characteristics (data sources, consolidation
functions, ...) and the graphs are described in a configuration file that we
can use to create new instances of a RRD, and to generate the graphs for
them.<br> It includes an extension which uses the configuration files to
poll an SNMP agent and stores the results in the related RRD. </description>
