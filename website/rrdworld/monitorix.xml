<description>Monitorix is a lightweight monitoring tool designed to monitor as many services as it can. At this time, it monitors from the CPU load and temperatures to the users on the system. Network device activity, network service demand, kernel usage and even the devices' interrupt activity are also monitored. It uses RRDtool as its logging and graphing back-end. The current status of any corporate UNIX/Linux server with Monitorix installed can be accessed via a Web browser. </description>
