<P>RRDtool is available under the terms of the <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</A>.
This means you can do most things you want with this software as long as you
do not claim you created the software and don't sell it (or modified version

<H2>Give Credit</H2>

<P>One of the things I get out of RRDtool is 'Being Known in the Industry'.
This only works if you give credit. This means that you
mention RRDtool on webpages and other publications containing graphs
created with RRDtool. If possible, a link should be included in the
publication, pointing to the RRDtool homepage. Best is to include one of the  RRD
TOOL logos on the page.</P>
