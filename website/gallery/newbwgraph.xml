      <title> Bandwidth Actual and Utilization </title>

<description> The graph represents bandwidth as both a hard value and
as % utilization.  I have had customers ask for one or the other and
decided to combine them into an effective and informative visual
smorgasbord. Code is for OpenNMS and looks a little different (see
link).    </description>
