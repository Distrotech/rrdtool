      <title> Fluxoscope Graph </title>
     <author> Simon Leinen </author> 
<description>  Fluxoscope is a system used by SWITCH for measurements of
    our external network traffic. One of its products are graphs which
    represent, for each external connection, the protocol distribution
    of traffic over time. The example graph shows the traffic
    distribution on one of our "upstream" or transit ISPs over a
    period of a few hours. The "positive" part of the graph shows
    incoming traffic (what we receive from the ISP), the "negative"
    part corresponds to outgoing traffic (what we send them). </description>
