      <title> RTT of MPLS VPN endpoints </title>
     <author> Bruno Ciscato </author>
<description>Although MPLS VPN endpoints seem just one hop away from
the IP point of view, there is always a more complex underlying
infrastructure.
Collecting endpoint RTTs (pings) and plotting them reveals the hidden
infrastructure. This image shows that there are 6 groups of endpoints
that have consistent
minimum RTTs. This is most likely due to the number of real hops in
the underlying infrastructure and can also be influenced by the last
mile technology. It's also easy to spot temporary re-routing: in this
example the light green endpoint plots temporarily out of his
"league".  </description>
