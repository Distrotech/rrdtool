      <title> Sinus-Regression of Server-Traffic </title>
     <author> Holger Kohn </author> 
<description> This graph shows the traffic of a
networkinterface(dark-green). In red is displayed the optimal
sinus-curve thru the points of one week. Light-green is the
"can-be-range" of the traffic that was not alarmed. Yellow is the
"warning-range" of the curve and every other points cause an
CRITICAL-Warning in our minitoring. So we bring the
statistics-calculations into the monitoring. That will show us abnormaly
using of different curves and alarm it. </description>
