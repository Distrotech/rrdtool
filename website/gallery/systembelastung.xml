    <description> These 2 graphs are displayed on a status page of my
small server at home. The colour green on black is used because I like these colours in combination with computers referring to the opinion of
windows user about linux console freaks that are all supposed to have these colours in their console command line interfaces and because it looks
somehow old school.
