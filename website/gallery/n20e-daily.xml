<description> A graph of the internal (green) and external (grey) temperature from an IP enabled thermostat. Red areas denote times when the heat
was on while blue denotes times when the air-conditioning was on. This graph also simulates translucent intersecting areas where the internal and
external temperatures can swap places without becoming unreadable. </description>
