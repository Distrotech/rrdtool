============


In this file I am noting the Major changes to rrdtool
for details check the cvs ChangeLog

2001/03/10 Jake Brutlag <jakeb@corp.webtv.net>
  Support for COMPUTE data sources (CDEF data sources). Removes the RPN
  parser and calculator from rrd_graph and puts then in a new file,
  rrd_rpncalc.c. Changes to core files rrd_create and rrd_update. Some
  clean-up of aberrant behavior stuff, including a bug fix. 
  Documentation update (rrdcreate.pod, rrdupdate.pod). Change xml format.
 
  
2001/03/07 Tobias Oetiker <oetiker@ee.ethz.ch> 
  Integrated complete rewrite
  of rrdgraph documentation by Alex van den Bogaerdt
  <alex@slot.hollandcasino.nl>. This also contains info on his planned
  changes to the rrdgraph module

2001/03/02 Tobias Oetiker <oetiker@ee.ethz.ch>
  Added Aberrant Patch from Jake Brutlag <jakeb@microsoft.com>
  From now one, new rrd files use version tag 0002. They can
  NOT be read by the old 1.0.x rrdtools. 
 
  Jake:
  Aberrant Behavior Detection support. A brief overview added to
  rrdtool.pod.  Major updates to rrd_update.c, rrd_create.c. Minor update to
  other core files.  Updated documentation: rrdcreate.pod, rrdgraph.pod,
  rrdtune.pod.  This is backwards compatible (i.e. new tool can read and will
  leave the binary header unchanged for old files).
