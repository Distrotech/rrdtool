RRDTOOL NEWS
============

#####################################
Major Changes between 1.2.x and 1.3.x
-------------------------------------

RRdtool dump / restore Incompatibilities
----------------------------------------
rrdtool dump 1.3 does emit completely legal xml. Basically this means that
it contains an xml header and a DOCTYPE definition. Unfortunately this
causes older versions of rrdtool restore to be unhappy.

To restore a new dump with ann old rrdtool restore version, either remove
the xml header and the doctype by hand (both on the first line of the dump)
or use rrdtool dump --no-header.

NEW File access methods (Bernhard Fischer)
-------------------
* introduced file-accessor functions rrd_read/rrd_seek/rrd_write
* implemented full mmap-based file access with madvise hints for improved
  scalability, much reduced memory-footprint and much less blocking on
  disk
* implemented optional full file-descriptor access instead of FILE* access

NEW Graphing (Tobi Oetiker)
--------
* libart has been replaced by cairo/pango
* pango markup is supported
* full gridfitting 
* --graph-render-mode=mono for non antialiased graphing
* --font-render-mode=mono for non antialiased fonts
* fonts come through fontconfig, use the Pango fontnameing
  scheme -> 'Times 20' ... it is not possible to use
  truetype fonts directly anymore.
* Tabs are position independent.
* TRENDNAN filter that ignores NAN values while caculating the TREND data. (Timo Stripf)
* --full-size-mode to specify the outer border of the image and not just of the graphing canvas (Matthew Chambers)
* TEXTALIGN command to alter default text alignment behaviour
* C API in-memory graphing with rrd_graph_v (Evan Miller)
* draw dashed lines in graphs (Thomas Gutzler)
* new interface graphv which returns inforamation using the rrd_info
  interface (Tobi Oetiker and Mark Plaksin)
* improved horizontal grid. Have a bit more grid lines and y-axis labels
  while keeping them fahr enough apart to not run into each other.

NEW Forecasting (Evan Miller)
-----------
* the new MHWPREDICT consolidation function uses a variation of the Holt-Winters
  method. It is a drop-in replacement for HWPREDICT, and is better suited for
  data whose seasonal variations grow or shrink in proportion to the average.

* If you create an RRD with the new MHWPREDICT function, the resulting
  rrdfile will be version 0004 and can only be used in rrdtool 1.3.

Rewrites
--------
* rrd_restore now uses libxml for parsing which makes things much more
  tolerant towards xml variations. The old code could mostly just parse the
  xml as it was output by rrdtool dump. See also: 'incompatibilities' at the
  top of this document. (by Florian octo Forster)

* rrd_update rewritten to make it more modular. Fixed two longstanding
  HW bugs in the process (Evan Miller)

Internationalization (Takao Fujiwara and Tobi Oetiker)
--------------------
* The help output by rrdtool has been internationalized. There are no real
  translations included with rrdtool yet, contributions are welcome.
* The internationalization will only be compiled if libintl and friends are
  available on your system. Use the configure option --disable-libintl if
  you want to disable this feature

Language Bindings
-----------------
* ruby rrd_fetch will return step as a last property -- Mike Perham

* python rrdtool.info does now conform with the data structure returned
  by the other language bindings. This is incompatible with the
  previous (broken) version --tobi

* python bindings got updatev support --tobi

* ruby, perl, python bindings support the new graphv interface --tobi

Locale Independent Numeric Input
--------------------------------
* Regardles of locale you are in, rrdtool always expects input to be numbers
  (LC_NUMERIC) in C or POSIX locale for numbers. (not 1,1 but 1.1) this is
  necessary to make things like RPN work as it uses , as a separator.

######################################################################################
Major Changes between 1.0.x and 1.2.x
======================================================================================
Graphing
--------

* rewritten graphics generation based on libart.
  - anti-aliased output
  - alpha transparency support
  - truetype fonts
 
* additional graphics formats: EPS, PDF, SVG

* extended multi-part documentation

* VDEF support; define and use variables.  Find, and use, the
  maximum rate seen by rrdtool; compute and show the average

* Sliding window (trend) analysis
  Compute a smoother average, for instance over the last 6 CDPs

* percentile (95th or other)
  Remove peaks, 95 percent of all rates are at or below the
  returned value

Logging
-------
* a second logging interface: rrdtool updatev
  Verbose updating of the database; show CPDs being created

* Aberrant Behavior Detection with Holt-Winters Forecasting
  Compare current data with expected data, detect and log when
  the rates are outside expected levels

* COMPUTE data type for artificial data-sources calculating their
  input using RPN math and data from the other data-sources.
 
Incompatibilities
-----------------
* Colons in COMMENT arguments to rrdtool graph must be escaped with a backslash

* the --alt-y-mrtg option is gone or rather since 1.2.7 it is back but
  without functionality.

* In pipe mode, rrdtool answers with OK only if it was successful with the
  command. Otherwhise the answer will be ERROR...


Behind the Scenes
-----------------
* In order to support Holt-Winters and Calculated Datasources,
  the rrdtool data format has changed. While the new version of rrdtool can
  read files created with rrdtool 1.0.x. It is not possible to read files
  created by rrdtool-1.2.x with rrdtool-1.0.x

* External libraries are not included with rrdtool anymore. This is in line
  with todays trend of using shared libraries everywhere. With the exception
  of the cgi library most things required by rrdtool will be found on every recent
  system.

* Memory Mapped IO support for faster logging.
